# leaflet_challenge
This is my Module 15 Challenge submission.
Overview: This code retrieves earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) in GeoJSON format, visualizes it on a map, and customizes the markers to represent earthquake properties. The code is written in JavaScript and uses the D3.js and Leaflet libraries for data retrieval, processing, and map creation.
